# Category
A Simple Category Demo in Objective-C.

# Definition
Category provides the ability to add the functionality to an object without subclassing or changing the actual object. Category is a handy tool, that can used to add methods to the existing classes, such as `NSString` or your own custom objects.

Here I have created a simple Demo of Category. I have created one category class and added one method called `removeNumbersFromString`. And Later I have used in my `ViewController`.
